found this rule for tyoescript-eslint: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/no-unnecessary-type-assertion.md

why dont we have it already? does it have an autofix? if so, why didnt we add it? did their autofix list not include this one? if so, should we try every rule for autofix instead of trunsting their docs?
