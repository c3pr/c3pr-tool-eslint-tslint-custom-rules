pr_title: Use === instead of ==
pr_body: |
  It is considered good practice to use the type-safe equality operators `===` and `!==` instead of their regular counterparts `==` and `!=`.

  The reason for this is that `==` and `!=` do type coercion which follows the rather obscure [Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3).
  For instance, the following statements are all considered `true`:

  * `[] == false`
  * `[] == ![]`
  * `3 == "03"`

  If one of those occurs in an innocent-looking statement such as `a == b` the actual problem is very difficult to spot.
